## Hardware Setup
- HP Microserver Gen 8
- 4x Seagate ST3000NM0035 3TB 7.2k 12Gb/s 3.5‚Äù SAS Hard Drive
- LSI HBA SAS 9207-8i
### Additional Things
- [Ventoy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ventoy/) (Optional)
- [Proxmox iso](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads/proxmox-virtual-environment/iso)
- [iLO liscense](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=sd00001039en_us&docLocale=en_US&page=GUID-821C2C6D-BCBF-408B-93F9-641EFFB16E29.html) (Optional)

The server that I am using has something called HP iLO which basically allows me to not have to connect a monitor to the server and be able to get a 'video output' through a web interface. With iLO, I could access the bios of the server and set configurations from a browser. 
I connected the SAS backplane from the server into the LSI raid card and used it in HBA mode to have individual access to each drive and to also do a ZFS RAIDZ setup. Raid card was also advertized to be used 'for zfs freeNAS' lol.
I was also introduced to which allows for multiple iso's to be on a single flash drive. But I really just needed to have the Proxmox iso on a flash drive and install it on the server.

## Down To The Beans
Used default setup settings for Proxmox, and named my root node `beans` cause it's funny.

### CT Templates
To get started with making containers, templates were an easy way to get things started.
- `pveam available` lists out all the available templates
- `pveam update` updates templates duh
Templates can then be eassily downloaded in `local` storage.

### Structure
`beans` is composed of 2 LXC containers and 1 VM
- [CT 101 (vpn-ddns)](#vpn-and-ddns-service)
- [CT 103 (docker)]
- [VM 100 (TrueNAS-scale)]

  ### VPN and DDNS service
  Purpose of a VPN is to have access to the Proxmox server when not at home, and DDNS is to make sure my ip address...
  
  I made a default LXC container with a template of ubuntu 20.04 - cause I couldn't find a template of 22.04 - and then the usual `sudo apt update`, `sudo apt upgrade`, and then `sudo apt dist-upgrade`
  After that, I installed wireguard using `wget https://git.io/wireguard -O wireguard-install.sh && bash wireguard-install.sh` from [here](https://github.com/Nyr/wireguard-install)
  I got the qr code and stuff on my phone and exported it to a file and now I have a profie I can import anywhere to use on whatever device.
